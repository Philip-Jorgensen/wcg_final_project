There is a lot of pollution coming from industry and other sources, which pollute the waters with chemicals like vinyl chloride among others, at the moment it is a long process of processing a water sample.

**Why:**
With the case of vinyl chloride it is mainly from the production of PVC, which is used in piping for plumbing or other use cases, vinyl chloride is a common by-product of PVC production.

**When:**
Not relevant

**Where:**
It is different water sources that are being contaminated, like wells and ground water.

**Who:**
It has the potential to effect everyone from the common person drinking tap water, to industries relying on ground water.
