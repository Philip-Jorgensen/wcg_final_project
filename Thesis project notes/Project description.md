Project Description – B.Eng. Thesis

# Background:

*The core behind this project, is in how there is a lot of waste being produced, which can have some biproducts that can end up polluting the waters.*

*One of the most toxic waste products that can be found in water, is vinyl chloride (VC), which is highly volatile making it hard to detect, which has created a need for a fast and simple solution for detecting VC in water.*

*This has led the company Water Care Guard, to develop an on-site lab kit in a suitcase which is able to test the water sample for the concentration of VC among other substances.*

*This project is in collaboration with Roana from SDU Nano Syd and Water care guard.*

In many different areas, humans produce waste, whether that is as an individual or industry. Some of these waste products end up in the water and contaminate it. One of the most toxic waste products that can end up in the water is vinyl chloride (VC), one of the primary areas VC is found is in the process of producing PVC. Vinyl chloride is highly volatile, making it hard to detect, which has created a need for a fast and simple solution for detecting the concentration of VC in water.

This has led the company Water Care Guard to develop an on-site lab kit that fits in a suitcase, which is able to test a water sample for the concentration of VC among other substances.

This project is done in collaboration with Roana from SDU Nano Syd and Water Care Guard.

# Problem:

*The first work package would be to go to the lab and use the lab suitcase and gather some data points to build a more robust database. More datapoints are needed for the different substances to get a more robust database that will be used to make the lab suitcase more accurate at estimating the contents of the water sample.*

*I would be doing some experiments where I am adding a known quantity of a monochloride like VC, and measuring the response on the sample then with enough data points I would be looking for the correlation between the response and the quantity added to the sample.*

*Then we would get a database in with a certain uncertainty and error bars etc.*

*The second work package would be to simplify the user interface of the suitcase laboratory. This involves both backend programming and content/front end programming in Python and embedded programming in C/C++. The programming that will be used throughout the project is on a higher level of abstraction, it is meant to work on an operating system like a mobile device. At the moment the laboratory is working with an external software with is more advanced and for a more scientific use, but since this lab should be able to be used by someone without certain qualifications, it should be simple and straightforward to use.*

*Simplifying the user interface is not only about the software part of it, but it could also involve the suitcase itself, and ways to make it easer to use for the end user in all aspects, that is, both the software and the hardware perspective.*

*We will be integrating into an external company (CBS)’s REST API, which will also be part of the work that I will end up doing.*
