Here, a method is presented for measuring the absolute refractive index dispersion of liquids using an array of photonic crystal resonant reflectors of varying periods. It is shown that by covering the array with a sample liquid and measuring the resonance wavelength associated with transverse electric polarized quasi guided modes as a function of period, the refractive index dispersion of the liquid can be accurately obtained using an analytical expression. This method is compact, can perform measurements at arbitrary number of wavelengths, and requires only a minute sample volume. The ability to sense a material's dispersion profile offers an added dimension of information that may be of benefit to optofluidic lab-on-a-chip applications.}",

The present article describes current state-of-the-art capillary GC in the analysis of various classes of persistent organic contaminants in air, water, soils, sediments and biota. Special attention is given to sample-preparation techniques. The organic pollutant groups covered in this review are: volatile organic compounds (VOCs); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); pesticides; and, halogenated compounds. These last include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyl, terphenyls, naphthalenes and alkanes, organochlorine pesticides, and the brominated flame retardants, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylethers. The use of capillary-GC columns, the type of column, the need for multi-dimensional GC techniques, and the advantages and limitations of the available detection systems for the analysis of these compounds are discussed. Trends and future perspectives of capillary GC in the field of environmental analysis are also commented on and discussed.}

    abstract = { Vinyl chloride (VC) is both a known carcinogen and a regulated chemical, and its production capacity has almost doubled over the last 20 years, currently 27 million tons/year worldwide. According to recent reports it is still a cause for concern. VC has been found as a degradation product of chloroethylene solvents (perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene) and in landfill gas and groundwater at concentrations up to 200 mg/m(3) and 10 mg/L, respectively. Worldwide occupational exposure to VC still seems to be high in some countries (e.g., averages of approximately 1,300 mg/m(3) until 1987 in one factory), and exposure may also be high in others where VC is not regulated. By combining the most relevant epidemiologic studies from several countries, we observed a 5-fold excess of liver cancer, primarily because of a 45-fold excess risk from angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). The number of ASL cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. The average latency for ASL is 22 years. Some studies show a small excess risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and others suggest a possible risk of brain tumors among highly exposed workers. Lung cancer, lymphomas, or leukemia do not seem to be related to VC exposure according to recent results. The mutation spectra observed in rat and human liver tumors (ASL and/or hepatocellular carcinoma) that are associated with exposure to VC are clearly distinct from those observed in sporadic liver tumors or hepatic tumors that are associated with other exposures. In rats, the substitution mutations found at A:T base pairs in the ras and p53 genes are consistent with the promutagenic properties of the DNA adduct 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine formed from VC metabolites. Risk assessments derived from animal studies seem to overestimate the actual risk of cancer when comparing estimated and reported cases of ASL. }

  author   = "Ghanayem, Burhan I and Hoffler, Undi",
  abstract = "Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) comprise a number of enzyme subfamilies
              responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of
              therapeutic agents, environmental toxicants, mutagens, and
              carcinogens. In particular, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is
              implicated in the oxidative bioactivation of a variety of small
              hydrophobic chemicals including a number of epoxide-forming drugs
              and environmentally important toxicants including urethane,
              acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, vinyl chloride, styrene,
              1-bromopropane, trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene,
              acetaminophen, and butadiene. Until recently, chemical modulators
              (inducers and inhibitors) were used in order to characterize the
              enzymatic basis of xenobiotic metabolism and the relationships
              between CYP-mediated bioactivation and chemical-induced
              toxicity/carcinogenicity. With the advent of genetically
              engineered knockout mice, the ability to evaluate the roles of
              specific CYPs in the metabolism of xenobiotics has become more
              attainable. The main focus of the current review is to present
              studies that characterized the enzymatic, metabolic, and
              molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and
              carcinogenicity of various xenobiotics using Cyp2e1-/- mice. Data
              presented in this review demonstrated that the most comprehensive
              studies using Cyp2e1-/- mice, encompassing the entire paradigm of
              metabolism to toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity were
              possible when a substrate was primarily metabolized via CYP2E1
              (e.g. urethane and acrylamide). In contrast, when multiple CYP
              enzymes were prevalent in the oxidation of a particular substrate
              (e.g.: trichloroethylene, methacrylonitrile, crotononitrile),
              investigating the relationships between oxidative metabolism and
              biological activity became more complicated and required the use
              of chemical modulators. In conclusion, the current review showed
              that Cyp2e1-/- mice are a valuable animal model for the
              investigation of the metabolic and molecular basis of toxicity,
              genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of xenobiotics.",

title = "Design and use of guided mode resonance filters for refractive index sensing",
abstract = "This Ph.D. thesis is concerned with the design and use of guided mode resonance filters (GMRF) for applications in refractive index sensing. GMRFs are optical nanostructures capable of efficiently and resonantly reflecting a narrow wavelength interval of incident broad band light. They combine a diffractive element with a waveguiding element, and it is the coupling between diffracted light and quasi guided modes that gives rise to the resonant response.The linewidth of the resonance can be tuned by the material and geometrical configuration of the device. The resonance wavelength is highly sensitive to changes in refractive index that occur within the region overlapped by the quasi guided mode, and GMRFs are thus well suited for optical sensing and tunable filter applications. They produce a polarization dependent response and can be optically characterized in both reflection and transmission.The structures investigated in this thesis were fabricated in a process based on nanoreplication, in which the surface of a polymer was patterned with a structured master, cured with ultra-violet light and coated with a high refractive index material. The masters were defined using electron beam lithography, a lift-off process, and reactive ion etching. After an introduction to the history and principles of GMRFs, the thesis describes the state-of-the-art of relevant research in the field, covers the necessary theoretical background required to understand their operation, and discusses the fabrication and characterization methods used. The thesis furthermore includes three journal articles. The first concerns an iterative computational model for the analytical prediction of the wavelengths at which resonances will occur, which is beneficial for e.g. device sensitivity optimization. The second paper discusses an all-polymer GMRF, which exhibits narrow resonance linewidths and a low detection limit, made by rapid and inexpensive fabrication methods. The third paper presents a novel method for measuring the refractive index dispersion of liquids using an array of GMRFs of different periods.",
