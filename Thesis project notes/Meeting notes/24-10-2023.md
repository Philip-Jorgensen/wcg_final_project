# [[24-10-2023]] - 24-10-2023

## Files


## Notes
When **DR** is here
- Work in the background with the suitcase, just the normal with water and VC (maybe enzyme?)
- They will just be recording and showing that in the background

Be careful of nested loops with large amounts of data

Maybe work directly with their API and go outside of the python library that they have.

Read through the pyspectroworks.py document and understand it

A Philosophy of software design | John Ousterhout | talks at google
- Youtube video

Talk with the other mechatronics students and see if there are some parts of it I could do maybe.

Simple -> complex

Different parts
- Work with a simple way of it (pyspectroworks module)
	- Familiarize yourself with the module
- Optimizing the code, (don't load everything)
