#### Procedure:
##### Measure RI for water to use it as a Reference in the "Choose reference" list.
**Lab 2:**
- Get a Nano-cuvette™ One from *Lab 2*
**Lab 1:**
- Pipette 2,5 mL of reference DI water in Nano-cuvette™ One

**Lab 2**
1. Turn on the spectrophotometer and stabilize it by letting it sit for at least 15 minutes before running any samples.
2. Set up the spectrophotometer for “number of scans” and “Integration time”
3. Choose “Create” and select the cuvette type.
4. Type in the cuvette batch and select the cuvette number.
5. Pipette 2,5 mL of reference DI water in Nano-cuvette™ One. (Done before)
6. From the “reference list” choose the reference liquid to be water.
7. Insert the reference sample (water) cuvette into the sample chamber of spectrophotometer and run the B side measurement first (with the photonic crystal).
8. Now it requires to measure the sample, in this case the sample is water. Turn the cuvette 90 degree and run the A side measurement. Next step is to turn the cuvette with the B side again and run the measurement. Don’t forget to name the measurement in the notes as water test.
9. **OBS! Please save the measurement only if the** **Sample fit quality** **is greater than 80 %.**

##### Measure RI for water and VC
> Whenever you are working directly with VC always work in the **fume hood**with **gloves** and a **lab coat**.

**Lab 1**
- Break a vile of VC into this glass container. In the **fume hood** with **gloves**, and **lab coat**.

- Pipette the desired 20 $\mu l$ of VC in the Nano-cuvette One from the previous step. Gently mix the reaction mixture for 30s-1min. In the **fume hood** with **gloves**, and **lab coat**. 

**Lab 2**
- Now it requires to measure the B side but **Press back** to go back to the A side measurement first and insert the cuvette (with the water and VC) into the sample chamber of spectrophotometer and run the A side measurement first *(without the photonic crystal)*
- Next turn the cuvette 90 degrees from the previous position, and run the B side measurement *(with the photonic crystal)*
- In the end a summary will be generated where you can find the results for water and VC, experiment setup, a graphic plot and notes. Don't forget to name the measurements in the notes.
- Repeat the measurements with the same cuvette re-using the water reference made in the beginning. Make the measurements in the following time points: 0min, 5min, 10min, 15min, 20min, 25min, 30min, 35min, 40min, 45min, 50min, 55min, 60min.
- Save the measurements as water + VC test (and time).
