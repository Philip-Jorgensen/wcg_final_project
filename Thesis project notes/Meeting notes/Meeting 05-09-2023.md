Potential
- Ipad in the suit case

Currently using spectroworks to control the suitcase (too complicated and too much control for the end user.)

Spectrometer (Ocean Insight -> Flame)
	The spectrometer version used in the suitcase

The configuration should be preset for the end user
Calibration
- Should be automatic
	- Tell the user *Close the box* then *press next* etc.
- After the calibration we can do some measurements.

Box code under the cuvette box
There is a number ID for each of the cuvettes

Calibrated with deionized water
Light source is from the left in the box.
Then we press capture

You have to add the sample and the enzyme.
For the study add the sample without enzyme and then with the enzyme.

First use pure deionized water as reference
Then remove the deionized water and add water from the well with vinyl chloride was added to the water solution
Then add the enzymes and extract the refractive index over time with intervals

The water from the well will have other components in it as well.

Use the water from the well as reference and then add enzymes

Take one measurement with the photonic crystal and one without
A reference without the photonic crystal

Turning the cuvette automatically is in the process of being solved.

The simplest possible way to do it in the system, the least number of steps.

Possibly take measurements from the time span (12m to 30m) every 2 minutes.
Optimizing the workflow for doing it in a simpler way.

Start by introducing to the lab
Then by going into the workflow

Workpackages:
- Database: 1 month
- Workflow: 1 month
- *Sketch*

There won't be time enough to develop the *whole* thing.

Preparing the enzyme for field use
- You will have a bottle of enzyme that needs to be diluted.

Keeping the enzyme cold (~-18C) maybe with dry ice around it in a box.
Small packages of prepared enzyme solutions ready to use.
