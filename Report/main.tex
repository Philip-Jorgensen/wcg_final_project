\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Humans have been producing waste for a long time, but as the materials that we use change so has our waste.
In the early 20th century with the invention of fully synthetic plastic by the Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland in 1907\cite{plastic_history}, started a new type of anthropogenic pollution.
One type of plastic known as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), which was first synthesized in 1872 by Dr. Eugen Baumann\cite{pvc_origin}, it was first plastasized by Dr. Waldo L. Semon in 1926\cite{history_pvc}.
The introduction of plastics and especially PVC plastics, has introduced a new biproduct which is a highly toxic volatile organic compound (VOC), called Vinyl Chloride (VC).
Vinyl chloride is a biproduct in the production of PVC plastics, from it being used as the main component in the production of PVC plastics.
PVC plastics are used in a lot of different areas like construction piping, packaging, wires, toys, etc. in figure \ref{fig:pvc_applications} some examples of PVC applications are shown.

\end{figure}

People can be exposed to vinyl chloride in different ways, through inhalating contaminated air, contaminated water etc.
If vinyl chloride contaminate a water supply to a household, it can contaminate the air in the household leading to the inhabitants being exposed to vinyl chloride. \cite{vc_cancer}
One of the main dangers with exposure to vinyl chloride is the increased risk of cancer, and in particular liver cancer.\cite{vc_cancer}
In addition according to \textit{"kemibrug.dk"}\footnote{A database for information regarding chemicals}, vinyl chloride can also affect the central nervous system with symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea and a possibility of loss of conscioiusness, as well as the inhalation the chemical is also easily absorbed through the skin which can lead to similar effects as of those from inhilation.\cite{vc_kemibrug}


At the moment the primary way to analyze whether there is vinyl chloride present in a water sample is through gas chromatography.
According to an article from F.J Santos and M.T Galceran some of the advantages of gas chromatography are that is has a very high selectivity and resolution, making it easier to detect even small quantities of vinyl chloride in the sample, in addition GC has a good accuracy and precision.\cite{SANTOS2002672}


Gas chromatography is a physical process where a mixture of different substances are separated into their different parts.\cite{waters_1978_gc}
There are two primary types of gas chromatography, gas-solid chromatography (GSC) and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), in gas-solid chromatography it is about the absorbtion of the sample on the solid and with gas-liquid chromatography it is about the solubility of the sample to the liquid. \cite{ambrose_1963_gc}
In the case of detecting the vinyl chloride it is GLC that is being used, since the sample to be tested for the concentration of vinyl chloride is usually water.
According to the "Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP)" some of the areas that there have been shown high levels of VC are "soil, groundwater, aquifiers, and wells near landfill and industrial waste disposal sites"\cite{vc_kielhorn_2000}.
Gas chromatography works by having a sample that is to be analyzed, that is injected into a moving gas stream.
It is then being carried down a column by a liquid with a low volatility, the sample is then separated into its different parts because the absorptivities and solubilities of the different parts differ making them arrive at different rates which makes it possible for the detector at the end to get a reading.\cite{ambrose_1963_gc}
The process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:glc_illustration}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Schematic illustration of a gas chromatography system. \cite{glc_illustration}}
    \label{fig:glc_illustration}
\end{figure}

A gas chromatograph is an expensive piece of laboratory equipment\cite{gc_cost_axion}, in addition it can take up to two weeks to get a sample analyzed in a laboratory\cite{water_analysis_cwt}.
This is why there is a need to be able to get a faster on-site detection of vinyl chloride concentration in water samples.
This is what the company Water Care Guard\footnote{https://www.watercareguard.com/} is working towards, with their suitcase laboratory.
Instead of using GC for detecting the vinyl chloride, it is using an enzymatic reaction between the vinyl chloride and an enzyme (Cytochromes P450), this enzymatic reaction changes the refractive index of the solution over time where the shift in the refractive index from the starting point is related to the concentration of the vinyl chloride in the solution.\cite{roana_vc_ri}\cite{Ghanayem2007-nb}.

\section{Theory}
This section will be explaining the relevant concepts, for the method that is used for detecting vinyl chloride in the Water Care Guard suitcase.

\subsection{What is \textit{Refractive index}?}
The definition of refractive index from The Britannica Encyclopaedia is:
\begin{center}
"measure of the bending of a ray of light when passing\\from one medium into another"\cite{ri_britannica}
\end{center}

The refractive index is defined as the the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction.\cite{ri_britannica}
Equation \ref{eq:ri} shows how the refractive index is calculated as either the ratio of the sine of the angles or as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum ($c$) over the speed of light in the medium ($v$).\cite{ri_mettler_toledo}
The angles, $i$ and $r$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:ri}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ri}
    n = \frac{\sin{i}}{\sin{r}} = \frac{c}{v}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Measuring vinyl chloride in a sample}
\subsubsection{General methodology}
During the measurement gathering process, there was a procedure that was followed for all the measurements, it was adapted slightly depending on what instrument the measurement was done on.
Firstly the instrument was turned, and proceeding with the steps only when the instrument had heated up.
With the Water Care Guard suitcase or with the Ocean Optics UV-650 UV-VIS\textsuperscript{TM}, the heat up wait was a fixed 15 minute wait, because those instruments did not have a heating status indicator telling when it was finished heating up.
On the other hand with the Shimadzu UV-1900\textsuperscript{TM}, there is a light on the front indicating the status, if it is yellow it is still heating and green when it is ready, this is indicated in figure \ref{fig:shimadzu_status}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{shimadzu_heating.jpg}
        \caption{Shimadzu UV-1900 warming up indicator}
        \label{fig:shimadzu_heating}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Shimadzu UV-1900 status indicator}
    \label{fig:shimadzu_status}
\end{figure}

After the instrument has heated up, a water reference measurement is then completed in the Spectroworks\textsuperscript{TM} software by Copenhagen Nanosystems
