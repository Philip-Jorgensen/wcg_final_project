## Notes

### Meeting prep
- Attempted to get the spectrolink in the photonics lab working, got only about 2-7% fit quality.
- Strange results from last VC+ enzyme measurement [Measurements graph.xlsx](C:\Users\phili\OneDrive%20-%20Syddansk%20Universitet\SDU\7%20Semester%20(E23)%20Thesis\Measurements%20graph.xlsx)
	- RI Shift doesn't fit compared to the expected results from the paper
		- High concentration?


### Notes

Ask Thomas (from cphnano) how can you fetch the RI data? (Working with Roana)

Show first build database, then show trends
Fetch RI data over time from this data, you can determine the shift.
**Give the concentration to the user** based on the RI shift. (Use the database to give a more accurate concentration)

1. Collect data
2. Fetch RI over time
3. How to analyze data for the shift
4. How to present the concentration to the user

Try to overcome the noise, make it more resilient for the user.
Noise because of this, but there is still a clear step (RI shit).

Try to reduce the concentration of enzyme to see the result.
If it is better we should change the protocol, otherwise just leave it as is.
