# WCG Final project
Fall 2023
This is the code for the final project of Philip JÃ¸rgensen

This github repo has different elements,
- There are documents for testint the api access with spectroworks
- A web-based GUI
- Code for processing the data from the measurements

### Web-based GUI
The web-based GUI is running on a Python Flask framework and is at the moment just a simple thing.
I am writing the html with Jinja for making it easier to handle multiple pages when that becomes necessary.
