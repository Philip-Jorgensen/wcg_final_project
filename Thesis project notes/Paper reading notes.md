Paper title:
>*Chemical aquatic pollution monitoring with portable agile methods: a demonstration of vinyl chloride detection in environmental waters*

## Notes

VOC are gas markers found in water -> consequence of chemical pollution.

NO portable solutions for detecting VOC in water.

Trichloroethylene and vinyl chloride (VC) are the most **toxic** and carcinogenic among all VOCs.

Demonstrate a fast and portable method for detecting VC.

The process for detecting the compounds is using GMR (guided-mode resonance).
	It is looking at the frequency spectrum of light passing through clean water, and then comparing that to contaminated water. There is going to be a shift in the frequency spectrum, which can be correlated to what compound is in the water.

A photonic crystal is a grated TiO$_2$ surface. 

RI -> Refractive index

The measurement technique can measure VC in concentrations as low as $0.05 \mu g/ml$
