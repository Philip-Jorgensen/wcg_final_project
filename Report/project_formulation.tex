\section{Background}
\textit{In many different areas humans produce waste, whether that is as an individual or industry. Some of these waste products end up in the water and contaminate it. One of the most toxic waste products that can end up in the water is vinyl chloride (VC), one of the primary areas VC is found, is in the process of producing PVC. Vinyl chloride is highly volatile, making it hard to detect, which has created a need for a fast and simple solution for detecting the concentration of VC in water.}

\textit{This has led the company Water Care Guard to develop an on-site lab kit that fits in a suitcase, which is able to test a water sample for the concentration of VC among other substances.}

\textit{This project is done in collaboration with Roana from SDU Nano Syd and Water Care Guard.}
